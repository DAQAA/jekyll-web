<p><strong>About the speaker(s):</strong></p>
<p>After years of delivering solutions from the more traditional SDLC approach Shawn Whitmore and Jeremy Braden first experimented with Agile concepts in November of 2008. A core principle to their decision making has always been keep it simple. Early in the adoption process story boards consisted of Tri-Fold Foam Display Boards with sticky notes and have since evolved into SharePoint Lists.</p>
<p>Today they support an organization of roughly 1,500 team members where all projects, small medium and large follow the iterative framework. With a team of 20 Delivery Managers (SCRUM Masters) project throughput is around 100 in-flight projects and an average of 14 deployments per month.</p>
