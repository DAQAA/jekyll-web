**Session:**
You’re Not as Smart as You Think: Improve Your Decision-Making Skills

We all think of ourselves as pretty smart. After all, we sent a man to the moon and can instantly send a message across the world. Unfortunately, we suffer from a nasty little thing known as the Overconfidence Effect, a bias that applies to almost everything we do, including judging our own intelligence. Overconfidence is one of the dozens of documented biases and shortcomings in human judgment and decision making. Brandon Carlson covers biases from the Availability heuristic, which causes us to associate an event's probability with its memorability, to the Affect heuristic, where a positive experience compels us to believe that the decision was good—regardless of the overall outcome. Brandon explains that understanding and planning for these biases can help reduce the impact they have on our daily decisions. We still may not be as smart as we think, but at least we have the tools to compensate.

**Location:** 
Principal Financial Group

This event is hosted at The Principal Financial Group.  750 Park Street (also known as Corporate 4 building).  Room 1A18.  You'll need to check in at the reception/security desk on the north side of the building using the public entrance.
