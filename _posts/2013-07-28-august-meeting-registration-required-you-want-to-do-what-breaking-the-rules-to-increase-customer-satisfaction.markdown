  content: Good afternoon.  I signed up for the training tomorrow but only can attend
    the first hour. If you prefer to give my "spot" to someone on the waiting list,
    that is fine.  I am a Principal employee so will stop by to see if there is an
    extra chair that I can use for the first hour.  I apologize for the inconvenience
    but a meeting conflict just came up.

<p>Customer satisfaction. Every customer support organization strives to increase and maintain a higher level of customer satisfaction. This is a story of how one software organization attempted to increase customer satisfaction by increasing predictability and response times to reported defects. Along the way they were able to establish trust with the customer support organization by implementing a process that seemed counter-intuitive to its stakeholders.</p>
<p><b>Presenter: Mike Prior</b></p>
<p>Mike started his Agile journey when he was first hired at GeoLearning. It was there that he met up with a group of great thinkers and continued to learn over good conversation and a few beers. Perfect match. After GeoLearning Mike did a stint with John Deere ISG and is currently helping push in the Agile initiative at DuPont Pioneer. On a more personal level Mike likes to lecture professional athletes on the pitfalls of "spending it all in one place" and "not giving it your all". He has also invested countless hours dreaming of being a pro golfer.</p>
