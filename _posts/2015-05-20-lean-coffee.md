#### Session: 
This will be our first [lean coffee](http://leancoffee.org/) in the Des Moines area .
We are limiting seating to 10 attendees to keep it managable and to judge interest. We are charging a minimal fee (most of which is going to EventBrite) to cover your beverage (coffee, tea, or soda) and to test if it decrease "no-shows".

Hope to see you there!
