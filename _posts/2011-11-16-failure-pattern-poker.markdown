<p><strong>Time: Thursday, November 17th from 6:00-8:00 PM</strong></p>
<p><strong>Location: <a title="Okoboji Grill" href="http://bit.ly/qrQK1k">Okoboji Grill</a></strong> in Johnston (large meeting room)</p>
<p><strong>Speaker: Arin Sime, <a href="http://agilityfeat.com/">AgilityFeat.com</a><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Topic: Failure Pattern Poker - an Agile Retrospective or Training Game</strong></p>
<p>Failure Pattern poker is a simple and fun way to get your team<br />
discussing how to address common failure patterns in projects, or to<br />
raise specific problems going on in their current projects.  You can<br />
use it as part of a training to help people apply basic agile and<br />
scrum concepts or as a retrospective game to get people talking.</p>
<p>During this session Arin will break the room into a couple of games of<br />
Failure Pattern Poker.  The focus will be on play and discussion<br />
rather than powerpoint.</p>
<p>Arin is an agile coach and owner of <a href="http://agilityfeat.com/">AgilityFeat</a>, a consultancy<br />
offering agile training and coaching as well as near shore development<br /></p>
