<p><strong>Speaker:</strong>Â Tim Gifford</p>
<p><strong>Topic:</strong>Â 7 (+/- 2) Steps to Agility </p>
<div>This presentation provides a clear path for your agile project by using a handful of simple steps. Don't expect an ambiguous restatement of the Agile Manifesto. You will learn specific steps that will challenge your team and delight your customers.</div>
<p><strong>About the speaker:</strong></p>
<p>After years of striving to improve requirements, technical specifications and the accuracy of his estimates, Tim Gifford discovered a better way to deliver software. And in 2004, he began teaching others how to do it.</p>
<p>Tim teaches the nuances of creating executable business requirements that validate software and nearly eliminate defects. Heâ€™s trained teams in both the United States and India on how to automate tests and deployments to reduce the time to market, minimize support and maximize new features.</p>
<p>He enjoys cooking and spending time with this wife and their three children. Tim is a consummate learner and after putting the kids to bed at night, he enjoys listening to podcasts, reading books and learning new techniques that challenge traditional thinking.</p>
