  content: Hi Mohammad - I won't be able to make the meeting this month - but would
    like to share something that is working well here - called Silent Agile - you
    can google it and get the gist of the process.  We have found it helpful for including
    those introverts that tend to not speak up during a group brainstorming/retro
    session.
