<p><strong>Topic: Four Things Product Owners Wish They Knew, But May Not Realize It</strong></p>
<p>Agile teams look to product owners to make decisions about what the right things are to build, and in what order. Unfortunately the Product Owners often do not come equipped with the techniques to do this effectively. Kent will discuss four techniques that teams can use to help their Product Owners make decisions about what to include in the product and when to include it.</p>
<p>These techniques include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to make informed decisions at the right time</li>
<li>Understanding purpose to determine when to use a unique approach</li>
<li>Determining multiple stakeholderâ€™s perspective on priority</li>
<li>How to look at value to help make decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Along the way, we'll also talk about other techniques that based on experience folks have found useful for their product owners.</p>
