title: May Meeting - This Thursday!
---
<p>Where: Okoboji Grill, Johnston IA</p>
<p>When: May 16, 2013 -- 6:00-8:00 PM</p>
<p>Topic: Velocity - What does it mean and do you even care?</p>
<p>This month we would like to discuss everybody's favorite topic: Velocity. I've been hearing quite a bit of discussion surrounding it lately and what better place to discuss it than with your community. Bring your thoughts and ideas for how you use (or don't use) velocity to plan and execute your Agile projects.</p>
<p>See you there!</p>
