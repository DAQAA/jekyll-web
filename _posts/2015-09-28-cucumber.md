  description: In today's agile / continuous integration environments, regression testing needs to happen on a weekly or even daily basis. Manually testing an end-to-end solution is time consuming and tedious. Test automation is often offered up as a solution but can result in efforts that are hard to understand and maintain. Come see how a team at John Deere used Cucumber and Selenium to automate their end-to-end test effort for a major web application. The tests automatically run on a daily basis and report out in plain english.
