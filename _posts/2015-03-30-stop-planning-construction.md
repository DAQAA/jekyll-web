**Session:**
Stop Planning Construction & Start Planning Development!

Most organizations approach planning in uncertain environments, somewhere between non-optimally and abysmally.  At issue are traditional planning models that rely on more certainty than is possible or practical in era of modern business where uncertainty will only continue to grow.  In this session, Matt draws upon his experience in software product development to show proven models for planning in less-knowable situations, including benefit mapping and flow-based road maps.  This session also will explain how to apply concepts such as options-thinking and triggers to create a more resilient and realistic plan.

**Location:** 
Gravitate
206 6th Ave, 6th Floor

This event will be hosted at Gravitate in the 6th floor conference room.
