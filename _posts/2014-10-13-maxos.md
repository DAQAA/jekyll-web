At Agile 2014, Andy Singleton presented his finding on what the top software companies from Silicon Valley are doing to destroy their competition.
 
Tim Gifford will review his findings and facilitate a discussion on his 'debatable points'.

Debatable points:

- More frequent releases can increase quality
- Culture does not need to be consistent
- Teams are not permanently multifunctional
- Programmers approve releases, not QA
- Productivity comes from bigger/more machines
- Machines will write code
- Sense, respond, self-manage, minimize planning
- Mythical Man Month is wrong
- Machines and continuous integration can replace layers of management
- Scrum and SAFe cannot compete with MAXOS
