  content: Probably a good thing Cecil didn't know he was doing agile back in 1997...
    especially since it didn't exist for another 4 years.

    I'll be most keen to hear your impressions as a facilitator and from the participants.
    Also, don't hesitate to blog about what improvements you'd suggest from your experiences.\r\n\r\nAll

  content: "Chris,\r\n\r\nI thought the most interesting part of the puzzle experiment
    for our group was that we focused more on the discussion of value rather than
    estimation. It seems that, to our group, estimation was largely irrelevant even
    though we were there to discuss estimation!"

<p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
<p>Over the last year or so software development estimates have become a popular topic. The popularity stems from the inherent fact that estimating software development is difficult. Some people are writing about ways to improve your estimates, while others are writing about how to develop quality software without estimates.</p>
<p>Some recent articles are fromÂ <a href="http://derailleurconsulting.com/blog/a-short-noestimates-faq" target="_blank">Chris Chapman</a>, <a href="http://softwaredevelopmenttoday.blogspot.de/2013/07/the-noestimates-how-to.html" target="_blank">Vasco Duarte</a>, <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PurposeOfEstimation.html" target="_blank">Martin Fowler</a>, <a href="http://xprogramming.com/articles/the-noestimates-movement" target="_blank">Ron Jeffries</a>, <a href="http://www.industriallogic.com/blog/stop-using-story-points" target="_blank">Joshua Kerievsky</a>, <a href="http://neilkillick.com/2013/08/14/noestimates-an-alternative-means-of-risk-management" target="_blank">Neil Killick</a>, andÂ <a href="http://zuill.us/WoodyZuill/2013/04/13/why-do-we-need-estimates" target="_blank">Woody Zuill</a>. In addition ThoughtWorks has published anÂ <a href="http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/sites/default/files/resource/twebook-perspectives-estimation_1.pdf" target="_blank">eBook</a> and Vasco Duarte held aÂ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7alhgSXKDI" target="_blank">Google Hangout</a>. There is also conversation on Twitter using the hashtagÂ <a href="http://www.twitter.com/#noestimates" target="_blank">#noestimates</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, Chris Chapman has created aÂ <a href="http://derailleurconsulting.com/blog/the-noestimates-puzzle-experiment" target="_blank">fun experiment</a> using puzzles to explore the idea of not using estimates. So we will be trying his experiment to generate critical thinking and conversation about whether estimates are necessary to produce quality software.</p>
