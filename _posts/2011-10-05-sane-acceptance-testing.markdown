  content: "What a great topic! I am over in Dubuque Iowa and I don't think I'll be
    able to make it to Des Moines on Thursday for the presentation.  Is there any
    way I could see the slides for the presentation or will it be recorded at all?\r\n\r\nAnother
    option might be... Would you be interested in brining this presentation to Dubuque?
    (I am the organizer for presentations at the Dubuque Ineta meetings.) We meet
    on the first Tuesday of the month at 5:30. We currently have an opening in December
    or early 2012.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nElizabeth"

  content: "Hi Elizabeth!\r\n\r\nI'm glad the presentation has piqued your interest!
    I'm not sure whether or not I can get my company (ThoughtWorks) to sponsor the
    travel, but I'd be happy to present in Dubuque if we can work out the logistics.\r\n\r\nI
    could make my slides available but I'm not sure they'll have any value on their
    own. My style is to keep slides sparse, providing visual cues during my speaking
    and demonstrating ideas in code.\r\n\r\nFeel free to email me: my email is at
    thoughtworks.com and is my first initial followed by my last name (no punctuation)."

  content: I would have loved to been able to attend tonight - was it recorded by
    chance?  If not, is there a recording of the session given elsewhere?  Doing a
    google search on the title didn't produce many relevant results...

<p><strong>Time: Thursday, October 20th from 6:00-8:00 PM</strong></p>
<p><strong>Location:Â <a title="Okoboji Grill" href="http://bit.ly/qrQK1k">Okoboji Grill</a></strong> in Johnston (large meeting room)</p>
<p><strong>Speaker: Paul Nelson, <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">Thoughtworks</a><br />

<p><strong>Topic: Sane Acceptance Testing With Cucumber</strong></p>
<p>While Acceptance Testing principles and tools have become pervasive, teams often stumble in the implementation. Best intentions are eroded over time by tests that stray from the values of effective communication and collaboration. In the worst cases, Acceptance Tests can start to feel like a burden rather than a boon. Paul Nelson, a Principal Technical Consultant at ThoughtWorks, Inc., guides you through common Acceptance Testing pitfalls and provides practical, effective solutions that will get your testing efforts back on track. Starting from a typical test example, you are guided through important principles, such as: Getting the Words Right, Managing Level of Detail, Dependency Isolation, refactoring in Safe Steps, as well as common abstraction patterns. Examples are shown in Cucumber, though the principles are equally applicable using other tools. Leave with a renewed confidence in your ability to regain control of your Acceptance Tests and restore them to the collaboration tool they once were. Stop working for your Acceptance Tests: make your Acceptance Tests work for you!</p>

<p>Paul's passion for software development began when a pair of Apple ]['s showed up at his high school through the beneficence of an anonymous donor. At the time he had no idea that pushing pixels around a green screen could ever be anything more than goofing around and having fun.<br />
Today as a ThoughtWorks Principal Consultant Paul travels the world, spreading his passion for finding pragmatic solutions to software development challenges in organizations of all sizes. Pair Programming, coaching teams and assisting C-level executives draft, socialize and implement overall testing strategies are a few of the ways he has applied his passion, empowering organizations to enhance their corporate culture and release quality products in record time... and he's still having fun!</p>
