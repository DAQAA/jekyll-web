title: 'April Meeting: Connecting with Your Community'
---
<h2>Connecting with Your Community</h2>
<p>With the recent growth in Agile practices within our community and your organization, building a support network has become more critical than ever to your success. Building on the foundation of community helping community, this month's Agile Iowa will give you a chance to connect with others who share your passions and challenges. Brandon Carlson and the Agile Iowa team will facilitate a workshop to help you find your "Tribe(s)" among central Iowa's Agile community. You don't have to be an expert to participate, simply bring your concerns, passions, and problems and let us hear them. We will connect you with people who can care about them and solve them with you.</p>
<p>To prime the pump, here are a few topics I'm interested in...</p>
<ul>
<li>Budgeting</li>
<li>Hiring</li>
<li>Test Driven Development</li>
<li>Lean</li>
<li>Data-Driven Requirements</li>
<li>Responsible Product Development (And I'm not even sure what that means yet!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope to see you there!</p>
