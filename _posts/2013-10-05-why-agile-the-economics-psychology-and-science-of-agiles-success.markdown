<p><strong>Speaker:</strong>Matthew Renze</p>
<p><strong>Topic:</strong>Why Agile? The Economics, Psychology, and Science of Agileâ€™s Success</p>
<div>Most presentations on Agile practices only cover what Agile is and how Agile practices work. However, in this session, weâ€™ll discuss why Agile practices like Scrum, TDD, and refactoring are so effective in terms of economics, psychology, and science. In addition, weâ€™ll explain the success of Agile practices with insights from various scientific fields including Information Theory, Network Theory, and Game Theory. Whether youâ€™re still unsold on the value of Agile, actively practicing Agile, or need to convince others of the value of Agile, this presentation is for you.</div>
