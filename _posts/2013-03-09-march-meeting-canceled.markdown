---
<p>Greetings!</p>
<p>Because of the delay of the <a title="February Meeting" href="http://agileiowa.org/2013/02/february-meeting/">February meeting</a> to last March 06, and the overlap of Spring Break, we will be canceling the March meeting. Mark your calendars and stay tuned for more details regarding our next meeting, planned forÂ Thursday April 18 "Connecting With Your Community".</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Brandon</p>
