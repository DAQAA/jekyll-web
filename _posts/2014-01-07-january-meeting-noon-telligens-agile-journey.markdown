<p><strong>Topic:</strong>Telligen's Agile Journey</p>
<div><p>Telligen, a West Des Moines-based Health IT company, began its foray into the agile space back in 2009. Since then Telligen has gone through several evolutions on its processes. It has teams that have cut their teeth on automated testing, TDD, point estimation, and other agile practices. The employee-owned company has been appraised at CMMI level 3 in both waterfall and agile SDLCs.</p>
<p>In this session, cross disciplinary team members from Telligen will provide a brief background on their experience with agile. The remaining time will be a Q&amp;A period discussing a wide variety of agile topics. Audience participation encouraged.</p></div>
